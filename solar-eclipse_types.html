<li>Total solar eclipses are a happy accident of nature. The
 sun's 864,000-mile diameter is fully 400 times greater
 than that of our puny moon, which measures just about
 2,160 miles. But the moon also happens to be about
 400 times closer to Earth than the sun (the ratio varies as
 both orbits are elliptical), and as a result, when the orbital
 planes intersect and the distances align favorably, the
 new moon can appear to completely blot out the disk
 of the sun. On average, a total eclipse occurs somewhere
 on Earth about every 18 months. </li><br>
<li>There are actually two types of shadows: 
the umbra is that part of the shadow where
 all sunlight is blocked out. The umbra takes
 the shape of a dark, slender cone. It is
 surrounded by the penumbra, a lighter,
 funnel-shaped shadow from which
 sunlight is partially obscured. </li><br>
<li>During a total solar eclipse, the moon casts its
 umbra upon Earth's surface; that shadow can
 sweep a third of the way around the planet in
 just a few hours. Those who are fortunate
 enough to be positioned in the direct path of
 the umbra will see the sun's disk diminish into
 a crescent as the moon's dark shadow rushes
 toward them across the landscape.</li> <br>
<li>During the brief period of totality, when the
 sun is completely covered, the beautiful 
corona — the tenuous outer atmosphere of
 the sun — is revealed. Totality may last as
 long as 7 minutes 31 seconds, though most
 total eclipses are usually much shorter.</li><br></font>

<li>A partial solar eclipse occurs when only the 
penumbra (the partial shadow) passes over you. 
In these cases, a part of the sun always remains 
in view during the eclipse. How much of the
 sun remains in view depends on the specific 
circumstances.</li><br> 
<li>Usually, the penumbra gives just a glancing
 blow to our planet over the polar regions;
 in such cases, places far away from the poles 
but still within the zone of the penumbra
 might not see much more than a small scallop
 of the sun hidden by the moon. In a different
 scenario, those who are positioned within a
 couple of thousand miles of the path of a
 total eclipse will see a partial eclipse.</li><br> 
<li>The closer you are to the path of totality, 
the greater the solar obscuration. If, for 
instance, you are positioned just outside 
of the path of the total eclipse, you will 
see the sun wane to a narrow crescent, 
then thicken up again as the shadow passes by.</li><br> </ul>
