            <h1>Characteristics Of Uranus</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Uranus is surrounded by a set of 13 rings.</li>
                <li>Uranus is an ice giant.</li>
                <li>Uranus has a thick atmosphere made of methane, hydrogen, and helium.</li>
                <li>Uranus is the only planet that spins on its side.</li>
                <li>Uranus spins the opposite direction as Earth and most other planets.</li>
                <li>Uranus is the second-least dense planet.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The seventh planet from the Sun with the third largest diameter in our solar system, Uranus is very cold and windy. The ice giant is surrounded by 13 faint rings and 27 small moons as it rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin sideways, orbiting the Sun like a rolling ball.
                The first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star. It was two years later that the object was universally accepted as a new planet, in part because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode
                William Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus after King George III. Instead, the planet was named for Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, as suggested by Johann Bode.</p>

            <h1>Characteristics Of Neptune</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Neptune is about four times wider than Earth.</li>
                <li> Neptune orbits our Sun, a star, and is the eighth planet from the Sun at a distance of about 2.8 billion miles</li>
                <li>Neptune is the Most Distant Planet.</li>
                <li>Neptune is the Smallest of the Gas Giants.</li>
                <li>Neptune's Surface Gravity is Almost Earth-like.</li>
                <li>Neptune has the Strongest Winds in the Solar System.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Neptune is dark, cold, and very windy. It's the last of the planets in our solar system. It's more than 30 times as far from the sun as Earth is. Neptune is very similar to Uranus. It's made of a thick fog of water, ammonia, and methane over an Earth-sized solid center. Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen, helium, and methane. The methane gives Neptune the same blue color as Uranus. Neptune has six rings, but they're very hard to see.Neptune is an ice giant. Most of its mass is a hot, dense fluid of "icy" materials – water, methane and ammonia – above a small rocky core.Neptune's atmosphere is made up mostly of molecular hydrogen, atomic helium and methane.</p>
