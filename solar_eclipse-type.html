<li>An annular eclipse, though a rare and amazing sight,
 is far different from a total one. The sky will darken
 ... somewhat; a sort of weird "counterfeit twilight" 
since so much of the sun still shows. The annular 
eclipse is a subspecies of a partial eclipse, not total. 
The maximum duration for an annular eclipse is 12
 minutes 30 seconds.</li> <br>
<li>However, an annular solar eclipse is similar to a total
 eclipse in that the moon appears to pass centrally
 across the sun. The difference is, the moon is too small
 to cover the disk of the sun completely. Because the
 moon circles Earth in an elliptical orbit, its distance
 from Earth can vary from 221,457 miles to 252,712
 miles. But the dark shadow cone of the moon's umbra
 can extend out for no longer than 235,700 miles; 
that's less than the moon's average distance from 
Earth(opens in new tab).</li> <br>
<li>So if the moon is at some greater distance, the tip
 of the umbra does not reach Earth. During such an
 eclipse, the antumbra, a theoretical continuation
 of the umbra, reaches the ground, and anyone 
situated within it can look up past either side of 
the umbra and see an annulus, or "ring of fire" 
around the moon. A good analogy is putting a penny
 atop a nickel, the penny being the moon,
 the nickel being the sun.</li> <br></font>

<font size=5 color="white"><ul type="disc">
<li>These are also called annular-total ("A-T") eclipses. This special type 
of eclipse occurs when the moon's distance is near its limit for the
 umbra to reach Earth. In most cases, an A-T eclipse starts as an 
annular eclipse because the tip of the umbra falls just short of 
making contact with Earth; then it becomes total because the 
roundness of the planet reaches up and intercepts the shadow tip
 near the middle of the path, then finally it returns to annular
 toward the end of the path.</li> <br>
<li>Because the moon appears to pass directly in front of the sun,
 total, annular and hybrid eclipses are also called "central" 
eclipses to distinguish them from eclipses that are merely partial.</li> <br>
<li>Of all solar eclipses, about 28% are total; 35% 
are partial; 32% annular; and just 5% are hybrids.</li> <br> </ul> </font>
