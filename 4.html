            <h1>Characteristics Of Jupiter</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Jupiter Is The Fastest Spinning Planet In The Solar System.</li>
                <li>The Clouds On Jupiter Are Only 50 km Thick.</li>
                <li>The Great Red Spot Has Been Around For A Long Time.</li>
                <li>Jupiter's Magnetic Field Is 14 Times Stronger Than Earth's.</li>
                <li>Jupiter Has 67 Moons.</li>
                <li>Jupiter Has Rings</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Jupiter is the fifth closest planet to our Sun and is the first planet beyond the relatively small, inner four, rocky planets.  It is the first of the four "gas giant" planets in proximity to the Sun.  Jupiter has 300 times the mass of Earth, but is less dense.  It is by far the largest planet in our solar system and has 2 1/2 times the mass of all the solar system's planets put together.  Jupiter has 63 known satellites and like Saturn, there is a large number of very small satellites orbiting Jupiter from about seven million to 13 million miles away.  In addition, the tiny satellites are all similar in structure, suggesting that they are pieces from a parent body.  Jupiter's average distance from the Sun is 480 million miles and takes nearly 12 years to make one revolution.  Like the rest of the gas giants, Jupiter has a ring, albeit small and flat.  Its rotation is the fastest of all solar system planets, rotating once on its axis every 10 hours.</p>

            <h1>Characteristics Of Saturn</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Saturn could float in water because it is mostly made of gas.</li>
                <li>It is very windy on Saturn.</li>
                <li>Some of these bits are as small as grains of sand.</li>
                <li>Saturn has more moons than any other planet in the Solar System.</li>
                <li>Saturn has a moon bigger than Mercury.</li>
                <li>You cannot stand on Saturn.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system. Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Saturn is not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Saturn also has dozens of moons From the jets of water that spray from Saturn's moon Enceladus to the methane lakes on smoggy Titan, the Saturn system is a rich source of scientific discovery and still holds many mysteries.
                The farthest planet from Earth discovered by the unaided human eye, Saturn has been known since ancient times. The planet is named for the Roman god of agriculture and wealth, who was also the father of Jupiter. Potential for Life.</p>
