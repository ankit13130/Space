                <li>Earth is the third closest planet to The Sun.</li>
                <li>It is the only planet we have found that contains life.</li>
                <li>Earth is 4.543 billion years old.</li>
                <li>Earth's surface is mainly water.</li>
                <li>Earth rotates at around 1000 miles an hour.</li>
                <li>Earth's atmosphere is made of gases.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the Sun were as tall as a typical front door, Earth would be the size of a nickel.Earth orbits our Sun, a star. Earth is the third planet from the Sun at a distance of about 93 million miles (150 million km).A day on Earth is 24 hours. Earth makes a complete orbit around the sun (a year in Earth time) in about 365 days.Earth is a rocky planet with a solid and dynamic surface of mountins, canyons, plains and more.Most of our planet is covered in water.Earth's atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other ingredients—the perfect balance to breathe and live.  Earth has one moon.Earth has no rings.Many orbiting spacecraft study the Earth from above as a whole system—observing the atmosphere, ocean, glaciers, and the solid earth.Earth is the perfect place for life as we know it.
                Our atmosphere protects us from incoming meteoroids, most of which break up in our atmosphere before they can strike the surface..</p>

            <h1>Characteristics Of Mars</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun.</li>
                <li>A day on Mars is 24.6 hours.</li>
                <li> Mars is about half the size of Earth.</li>
                <li> Mars is known as the Red Planet because the iron oxide chemicals in its soil looks like rust.</li>
                <li>Mars is named for the ancient Roman god of war.</li>
                <li>Mars has two small moons.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Its surface is rocky, with canyons, volcanoes, dry lake beds and craters all over it. Red dust covers most of its surface. Mars has clouds and wind just like Earth. Sometimes the wind blows the red dust into a dust storm. Tiny dust storms can look like tornados, and large ones can be seen from Earth. Mars’ large storms sometimes cover the entire planet.

                Mars has about one-third the gravity of Earth. A rock dropped on Mars would fall more slowly than a rock falls on Earth. A person who weighs 100 pounds on Earth would only weigh about 38 pounds on Mars because of the reduced gravity.
                
                The atmosphere of Mars is much thinner than Earth’s. The Red Planet's atmosphere contains more than 95% carbon dioxide and much less than 1% oxygen. People would not be able to breathe the air on Mars.</p>
