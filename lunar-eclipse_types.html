<font size=5 color="white"><ul type="disc">
<li>This occurs when the Moon passes through Earth's penumbra. 
The penumbra causes a subtle dimming of the lunar surface,
 which is only visible to the naked eye when about 70% of 
the Moon's diameter has immersed into Earth's penumbra.
A special type of penumbral eclipse is a total penumbral
 lunar eclipse, during which the Moon lies exclusively
 within Earth's penumbra. </li> <br>
<li>Total penumbral eclipses are rare, and when these occur, 
the portion of the Moon closest to the umbra may appear
 slightly darker than the rest of the lunar disk.</li> <br> </ul> </font>

<font size=5 color="white"><ul type="disc">
<li>This occurs when only a portion of the Moon enters Earth's umbra, 
while a total lunar eclipse occurs when the entire Moon enters the 
planet's umbra. The Moon's average orbital speed is about 1.03 km/s 
(2,300 mph), or a little more than its diameter per hour, so totality
 may last up to nearly 107 minutes. Nevertheless, the total time between
 the first and the last contacts of the Moon's limb with Earth's shadow
 is much longer and could last up to 236 minutes.</li> <br> </font>

<font size=5 color="white"><ul type="disc">
<li>A selenelion or selenehelion, also called a horizontal eclipse, occurs 
where and when both the Sun and an eclipsed Moon can be observed
 at the same time. The event can only be observed just before sunset 
or just after sunrise, when both bodies will appear just above opposite
 horizons at nearly opposite points in the sky. A selenelion occurs
 during every total lunar eclipse-- it is an experience of the observer,
 not a planetary event separate from the lunar eclipse itself. </li> <br>
<li>Typically, observers on Earth located on high mountain ridges
undergoing false sunrise or false sunset at the same moment of a
 total lunar eclipse will be able to experience it. Although during 
selenelion the Moon is completely within the Earth's umbra,
 both it and the Sun can be observed in the sky because atmospheric 
refraction causes each body to appear higher (i.e., more central)
 in the sky than its true geometric planetary position.</li> </ul> </font>
