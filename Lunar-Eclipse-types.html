<li>This occurs when the Moon falls entirely within the Earth's umbra. 
Just prior to complete entry, the brightness of the lunar limb-- the
 curved edge of the Moon still being hit by direct sunlight-- will 
cause the rest of the Moon to appear comparatively dim. The 
moment the Moon enters a complete eclipse, the entire surface
 will become more or less uniformly bright</li> <br>
<li> Later, as the Moon's opposite limb is struck by sunlight, the 
overall disk will again become obscured. This is because as 
viewed from the Earth, the brightness of a lunar limb is generally
 greater than that of the rest of the surface due to reflections
 from the many surface irregularities within the limb: sunlight 
striking these irregularities is always reflected back in greater 
quantities than that striking more central parts, and is why 
the edges of full moons generally appear brighter than the rest
 of the lunar surface.</li>  <br>
<li>This is similar to the effect of velvet fabric over a convex
 curved surface which to an observer will appear darkest 
at the center of the curve. It will be true of any planetary 
body with little or no atmosphere and an irregular cratered 
surface (e.g., Mercury) when viewed opposite the Sun.</li>  <br> </ul> </font>

<font size=5 color="white"><ul type="disc">
<li>This is a total lunar eclipse during which the 
Moon passes through the centre of Earth's shadow, 
contacting the antisolar point. This type of lunar 
eclipse is relatively rare.</li> <br>
<li>The relative distance of the Moon from Earth at the time of an eclipse can 
affect the eclipse's duration. In particular, when the Moon is near apogee,
 the farthest point from Earth in its orbit, its orbital speed is the slowest. 
The diameter of Earth's umbra does not decrease appreciably within the 
changes in the Moon's orbital distance. Thus, the concurrence of a totally
 eclipsed Moon near apogee will lengthen the duration of totality.</li> <br> </ul> </font>
