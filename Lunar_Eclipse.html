<li>A lunar eclipse is an astronomical event that occurs when the
 Moon moves into the Earth's shadow, causing the moon to be 
darkened.[1] Such alignment occurs during an eclipse season,
 approximately every six months, during the full moon phase,
 when the Moon's orbital plane is closest to the plane of the
 Earth's orbit.</li><br>
<li>This can occur only when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are exactly 
or very closely aligned (in syzygy) with Earth between the other
 two, which can happen only on the night of a full moon when the
 Moon is near either lunar node. The type and length of a lunar 
eclipse depend on the Moon's proximity to the lunar node.</li><br>
<li>When the moon is totally eclipsed by the Earth, it takes on a 
reddish color that is caused by the planet when it completely 
blocks direct sunlight from reaching the Moon surface, as
 only the light reflected from the lunar surface has been 
refracted by Earth's atmosphere. This light appears reddish
 due to the Rayleigh scattering of blue light, the same reason
 sunrise and sunsets are more orange than during the day.</li><br> </ul> </font>
